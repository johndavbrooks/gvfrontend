## Development Notes

- The application requires a valid backend server and image server to function properly
- User registration requires email verification
- Student roles have access to all features
- Instructor roles have additional access to view enrolled students

## Configuration

Environment variables can be configured in a `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_IMAGE_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see CORS errors, ensure the backend has proper CORS configuration
- If images don't load, verify the image server is running correctly
- Login issues may require clearing localStorage and cookies
